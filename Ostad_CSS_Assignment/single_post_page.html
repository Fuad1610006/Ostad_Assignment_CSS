      <h2>Hyderabadi Biriyani</h2>
      <div>

          Hyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and meat (mostly mutton). 
           Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine 
          and it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad. 
        </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine. 
               Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition. 
              In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture, resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Origin</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. Despite legends attributing it to the Nizam's chef, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties 
              brought to South Asia by Arab traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. 
              The distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" is arbitrary. Hyderabadi biryani developed engrossing Deccani or Telangana flavors into it, as stated by the Himayat Ali Mirza,
              the great-grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan. Himayat said that this evolution had taken place in the Asaf Jah's Kitchen.

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Base ingredients are basmati rice, goat meat or (sometime chicken or beef), dahi, fried onion and ghee. Spices include cinnamon, cloves, cardamom (elaichi), bay leaves,
              nutmeg, papaya paste, caraway (shahi jeera), mace flower (javitri), star anise (biryani flower), lemon, and saffron. 
              Hyderabadi biryani is of two types: the kachchi (raw) biryani, and the pakki (cooked) biryani.

      <h2>Beef Khichuri</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          It's been raining a lot lately.  When it pours on the outside with dark cloud surrounding the environment, Bengalis crave for kichuri. 
          A piping hot plate of khichuri is just what the heart desires when a Bengali come home soaked from the rains. Some Tagore songs on the background, 
          and a quick nap if someone can squeeze it in is the definition of a classic rainy day for Bengalis. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Rain is almost synonymous with eating khichuri for Bengalis. It is the ultimate comfort food for rainy days or any days as a matter of fact. 
          Bengalis have a very soft spot for this down home one-pot rice dish. The aromas of rice, dal flavored with ghee is intricately intertwined with 
          the smell of the wet earth fresh from the raindrops. In Bangladesh, khichuri is mainly served with fried Hilsha, beef rezala or an egg curry and alu bhorta. 
          A simple omelette served with khichuri can also be a simple delicious soulfood for Bangladeshis. In my family, we often make a quick pickled onion to serve with kichuri. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Khichuri recipes vary from one household to another. The consistency differs, the spices differ, and sometime the ingredients such as the type of lentil or vegetables put in the 
          mishmash may differ depending on the personal preference. However, with all its differences, khichuri is an easy meal to prepare and guaranteed to be delicious each time. 
          Bhuna khichuri has a pilaf like texture and considerably drier than other versions of khichuri.  My mom makes bhuna khichuri with mung bean. 
          The Bengali khichuri is what the world calls Khichdi and the British calls Kichdee. Other alternatives you may see is khichri, khichdee, khichadi, khichari, kitcheree, kitchree and so on. 
          This rice dish can be served on a regular day or during parties and celebrations.

      <h2>Chicken Pulao</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Pulao is a close cousin of Biriyani and varies in many aspects. It is so much lighter, less spicy & less greasy than a Biriyani. This makes it more of a comfort food than a luxarious treat. 
          In Indian cuisine, vegetable pulao is very popular and is made more often in the homes.However you won't find Chicken Pulao being made often since a lot people love Biriyani over pulao. 
          Growing up, My mom made this Chicken Pulao more often for a weekend meal. It was served with Korma. Down in South India, West Bengal as well as in our country, a pulao is always served 
           with a gravy side dish like Korma. Basically pulao is a toned-downed version of Biriyani and is a one pot dish that is not layered. Chicken Pulao can be made in a regular pot, 
            traditional pressure cooker or instant pot.
